            >"Over the course of her remarkable life, Maya was many things — an
            author, poet, civil rights activist, playwright, actress, director,
            composer, singer, and dancer. But above all, she was a storyteller —
            and her greatest stories were true. A childhood of suffering and
            abuse actually drove her to stop speaking — but the voice she found
            helped generations of Americans find their rainbow amidst the
            clouds, and inspired the rest of us to be our best selves."</i
